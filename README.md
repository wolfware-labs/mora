# Mora

[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/wolfware-labs/mora-lang?logo=codecov&label=coverage)](https://codecov.io/gh/wolfware-labs/mora-lang)

Mora is a programming language with the syntax and feel of modern C#, memory managed by reference counting and single ownership instead of a garbage collector, and compilation to one native executable. It borrows C#'s look and idioms without copying the language: no exceptions, no inheritance, no `null` references. The compiler, runtime, language server and package tool are written in Rust.

```mora
Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
```

## Status

Mora is in design and early development. Nothing here is ready to install.

- [Specification](docs/design/mora.md): the language, its memory model, runtime, standard library and toolchain, as the MVP is built against them.
- [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md): milestones M0 to M13, with every MVP deliverable tracked as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/wolfware-labs/mora-lang/issues).

The MVP is done when a REST API with JSON bodies, written in Mora, builds into a native executable on Linux, macOS and Windows, and a developer new to Mora can install the toolchain with one command and get diagnostics in VS Code.
