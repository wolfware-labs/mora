# Mora roadmap

Companion to [`docs/design/mora.md`](docs/design/mora.md). The spec defines what Mora is; this roadmap orders the work, states what each milestone delivers and how each deliverable is proven.

## How to use this document

- Work milestones in order. M0 builds the foundations, M1 is a walking skeleton on all three operating systems, and each later milestone deepens one area.
- Every deliverable has an ID (`M2.4`) used in its issue title, its branch name and the subject of its commit. Spec references look like §10.4 and link to the spec.
- One deliverable is one issue and one pull request, with its code and its tests.
- **Blocked by** lists direct prerequisites only, and never a later deliverable.
- A milestone is done only when its exit criteria pass in CI.
- Spec first: a behaviour change updates `docs/design/mora.md` in the same pull request, before or with the code.
- `[verify]` marks third-party behaviour that a test or a manual check must confirm before code relies on it.

## Release lines

| Line | Milestones | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **MVP (v0.1)** | M0 to M7 | The REST API of §2.2 builds into a native executable on Linux, macOS and Windows, with editor support and installers |
| **v0.2** | M8, M9, M16 | Libraries and packages, with capability grants, semantic diff and semver checks, and the rest of the agent toolchain |
| **v0.3** | M14, M15, M17 | Contracts and property tests, the world simulator, record and replay, hot reload, and standard library growth |
| **v0.4** | M10, M11, M18 | Threads, language growth and the optimizer passes left after the MVP |
| **v0.5** | M12, M13 | The package registry and signing, the LLVM backend and more targets |

Post-MVP milestones are broken into deliverables when each one starts, after its spec sections are updated.

## M0: Foundations

**Goal.** Repository, CI on Linux, macOS and Windows, workspace crates and layering check, spans and diagnostics, error-code registry, test harnesses, and a runtime skeleton built for every Tier 1 target.

**Exit criteria.** CI is green on all three OSes; the UI, run and spec-example harnesses run an empty suite; `cargo xtask layers` enforces §14.2.

### M0.1 Repository governance and templates

Spec: [§21](docs/design/mora.md#21-project-conventions). Crates: repository. Blocked by: none.

Public-repository files: README with status, MIT and Apache-2.0 licenses, NOTICE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING (checks, commit format with roadmap IDs, signed commits, squash merge, spec-first rule), CLA and the CLA workflow, issue forms, pull request template, CODEOWNERS, Dependabot for Cargo and Actions, and the label set of §21.

Done when:

- The CLA check runs on a test pull request from a second account and passes after signing.
- Issue forms add `needs-triage`; the pull request template asks for the roadmap ID and `Closes #`.
- Every label of §21 exists in the repository.

### M0.2 Cargo workspace and lint configuration

Spec: [§14.2](docs/design/mora.md#142-crates), [§21](docs/design/mora.md#21-project-conventions). Crates: `all`. Blocked by: M0.1.

Workspace `Cargo.toml` with every crate of §14.2 as an empty library (`mora-cli` as a binary, `mora-rt` as `staticlib` plus `rlib`), workspace dependency versions pinned as §14.2 lists them, `rust-toolchain.toml` at 1.99.1, `clippy.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`, `deny.toml` (licenses, sources, advisories) and `.cargo/config.toml` with the `xtask` alias.

Done when:

- `cargo build --workspace`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `cargo deny check` pass.
- Each crate's `lib.rs` has a crate doc comment stating its responsibility from §14.2.

### M0.3 CI workflow on Linux, macOS and Windows

Spec: [§20.5](docs/design/mora.md#205-continuous-integration), [§19.1](docs/design/mora.md#191-targets). Crates: repository. Blocked by: M0.2.

`ci.yml` running fmt, clippy, tests, docs and `cargo deny` on `ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `macos-latest`, `windows-2025` and `windows-11-arm`, with a change filter that skips the Rust build for Markdown-only changes but never for `docs/design/mora.md`, `docs/errors/` or `docs/guide/`, whose executable examples must run, `!cancelled()` so one run reports every failing check, `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`, and every third-party action pinned by commit SHA.

Done when:

- A pull request shows one required check per job and they pass.
- A change to `README.md` alone completes without building; a change to `docs/design/mora.md` alone is not skipped.
- A repository ruleset on `main` requires the `ci-ok` job, which passes only when every other job passed or was skipped by the change filter.

### M0.4 Crate layering check

Spec: [§14.2](docs/design/mora.md#142-crates). Crates: `xtask`. Blocked by: M0.2.

`cargo xtask layers` reads `cargo metadata` and fails when a workspace crate depends on a crate in the same or a higher layer of §14.2, or when `mora-rt` depends on any workspace crate.

Done when:

- A test fixture with an upward dependency makes the check fail with the offending edge in the message.
- The check runs in CI.

### M0.5 Spans, files and the analysis database

Spec: [§14.3](docs/design/mora.md#143-the-analysis-database). Crates: `mora-span`. Blocked by: M0.2.

`FileId`, `Span`, `TextRange`, a `LineIndex` that converts offsets to line and column in UTF-8 bytes and in UTF-16 code units (for the LSP), string interning, and the base `salsa` database with file-text and project inputs.

Done when:

- Round-trip tests between offsets and both column encodings on ASCII, multi-byte and astral-plane text, including CRLF lines.
- A `salsa` input change invalidates exactly the dependent test query.

### M0.6 Diagnostics and rendering

Spec: [§17.6](docs/design/mora.md#176-diagnostics). Crates: `mora-diag`. Blocked by: M0.5.

The one `Diagnostic` type of §17.6: code, severity, primary and secondary labeled spans, message, note, fixes as text edits. Terminal rendering with `annotate-snippets` in the layout §17.6 shows, and `--message-format json` output with one object per line.

Done when:

- A golden test renders the `MR0310` example of §17.6 byte for byte (colors off).
- JSON output round-trips through `serde_json` with every field of §17.6.

### M0.7 Error-code registry

Spec: [§17.6](docs/design/mora.md#176-diagnostics), [§20.4](docs/design/mora.md#204-executable-examples). Crates: `mora-diag`, `xtask`. Blocked by: M0.6.

A single registry of every `MR` code with its range from §17.6, a `docs/errors/MRnnnn.md` page template (explanation, failing example, fixed example), and `cargo xtask error-codes`, which fails when a code is used without a page, a page has no code, or a code sits outside its range.

Done when:

- The check fails on a fixture with an unregistered code.
- `docs/errors/README.md` explains how to add a code.
- The `linux` job in `ci.yml` runs `cargo xtask error-codes`, so it also runs for changes to `docs/errors/` (§20.5).

### M0.8 UI and run test harnesses

Spec: [§20.1](docs/design/mora.md#201-test-layers). Crates: `mora-testkit`. Blocked by: M0.6.

Harnesses for `tests/ui` (`//~ ERROR MRnnnn` annotations on lines, rendered-output snapshots, `--bless` to update) and `tests/run` (`// expect:` stdout, `// exit:` code, run through JIT and AOT once those exist, outputs compared). Each harness discovers files, runs them in parallel and reports failures with a diff.

Done when:

- Self-tests with a fake compiler cover a missing annotation, an unexpected error, a stdout mismatch and an exit-code mismatch.
- `cargo test` runs both harnesses.

### M0.9 Executable spec examples

Spec: [§1.6](docs/design/mora.md#16-how-to-read-this-document), [§20.4](docs/design/mora.md#204-executable-examples). Crates: `xtask`. Blocked by: M0.8.

`cargo xtask spec-examples` extracts every `mora` code block in `docs/design/mora.md` and `docs/errors/*.md` whose first line is `// expect:` or `// error:` and runs it through the run or UI harness. Examples for features not yet built are listed in `tests/spec-examples.pending` with the deliverable that will enable them; the check fails when a pending example starts passing, so the list only shrinks.

Done when:

- Every example in the spec is either run or listed as pending with a deliverable ID.
- The `linux` job in `ci.yml` runs `cargo xtask spec-examples`, so it also runs for changes that touch only `docs/design/mora.md`, `docs/errors/` or `docs/guide/` (§20.5).

### M0.10 Runtime skeleton: portable core and hosted layer

Spec: [§13.1](docs/design/mora.md#131-the-runtime-library), [§13.2](docs/design/mora.md#132-two-builds-of-the-runtime), [§19.1](docs/design/mora.md#191-targets), [§19.4](docs/design/mora.md#194-portability). Crates: `mora-rt-core`, `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M0.3.

`mora-rt-core` as a `#![no_std]` crate that reaches the platform only through the `mora_pal_*` functions of §19.4, and `mora-rt` as the hosted layer implementing them with the Rust standard library. CI builds `mora-rt-core` for `thumbv7em-none-eabihf`. `mora-rt` is built as a static library that bundles `mora-rt-core`, in release and debug variants, for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm` and `aarch64-pc-windows-gnullvm`. Exposes a stub entry point that calls an extern `__mora_main` and returns its exit code. CI builds every variant.

Done when:

- A C test program linked against each Linux and Windows variant on its native runner exits with the code `__mora_main` returns.
- Both variants build on every Tier 1 runner.
- The `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` build of `mora-rt-core` is a required CI check.

### M0.11 Bundled linkers and sysroots for development

Spec: [§14.14](docs/design/mora.md#1414-linking), [§19.2](docs/design/mora.md#192-toolchain-archive). Crates: `xtask`, `mora-link`. Blocked by: M0.10.

`cargo xtask sysroot` downloads pinned `lld` binaries, the musl sysroot and the llvm-mingw pieces by URL and SHA-256 into `target/sysroot`, laid out as `lib/` of §19.2, so development builds link exactly as release toolchains do. Records each component's license in `LICENSES/`.

Done when:

- The download verifies hashes and refuses a mismatch.
- License review recorded in the pull request for lld, musl and mingw-w64 [verify].

### M0.12 CLI skeleton

Spec: [§17.1](docs/design/mora.md#171-commands). Crates: `mora-cli`. Blocked by: M0.6.

`mora` with every MVP subcommand of §17.1 registered (unimplemented ones print `not implemented yet` and exit 2), `mora version`, `--color`, `--message-format`, and the exit codes of §17.1.

Done when:

- CLI tests check `mora --help`, `mora version` and the exit code of an unknown subcommand.

### M0.13 Target descriptions

Spec: [§19.4](docs/design/mora.md#194-portability), [§17.2](docs/design/mora.md#172-manifest). Crates: `mora-target`, `targets`. Blocked by: M0.2.

The `mora-target` crate and `targets/*.toml` for every target of §19.1: triple, pointer width, endianness, alignments, object format, linker flavor, runtime layer, backend and platform capabilities, the `@Cfg` values derived from them, and loading a custom description from a path. A 32-bit test description (`tests/targets/test32.toml`) for layout tests.

Done when:

- Every built-in description parses and round-trips; an unknown key is an error.
- `cargo xtask layers` forbids target-name matching outside `mora-target`, `mora-link` and `mora-codegen` (a grep-based check with an allow list).

## M1: Hello, native

**Goal.** Parse every construct of the language, type-check the subset needed for functions, structs, primitives, strings and control flow, and produce a native executable for §2.1 on every Tier 1 target.

**Exit criteria.** §2.1 builds and runs on every Tier 1 target in CI; the M1 run tests pass through JIT and AOT.

### M1.1 Lexer

Spec: [§3](docs/design/mora.md#3-source-text-and-lexical-structure). Crates: `mora-syntax`. Blocked by: M0.5, M0.6.

Tokens and trivia for the whole language: identifiers with `@` and NFC normalization, every keyword and contextual keyword of §3.4, integer, real, character and every string form of §3.5 (regular, verbatim, raw, interpolated with nested holes, `u8`), comments and doc comments, `#region`, and the operators of §3.6. `logos` for ordinary tokens, a hand-written sub-lexer with a mode stack inside strings.

Done when:

- Table tests for every literal form and escape, including `MR0001` and `MR0010`.
- Concatenating every token's text reproduces the input for every file in `tests/` (fuzzed in M1.4).

### M1.2 Syntax tree and typed AST

Spec: [§14.4](docs/design/mora.md#144-lexer-and-parser). Crates: `mora-syntax`, `xtask`. Blocked by: M1.1.

Syntax kinds, the `rowan` green and red trees behind `mora-syntax`'s own API, and typed AST views generated by `cargo xtask codegen` from a grammar file `crates/mora-syntax/mora.ungram` that mirrors the EBNF of the spec.

Done when:

- `cargo xtask codegen --check` fails when the generated code is stale.
- Unit tests navigate the AST of hand-built trees.

### M1.3 Parser: items and declarations

Spec: [§4](docs/design/mora.md#4-program-structure), [§6](docs/design/mora.md#6-declarations), [§9.2](docs/design/mora.md#92-declaring-macros). Crates: `mora-syntax`. Blocked by: M1.2.

Recursive-descent parsing of compilation units: using directives, attributes, every type declaration (struct and positional struct, class, unique class, union, enum, interface, `ref struct`, `macro`), extension blocks, members (fields with `mut(...)` write scopes, `=>` and `stored` getters, indexers, methods with `uses` bounds, constructors including primary constructors, destructors, operators, conversions), modifiers, type parameters and constraints, with recovery at member and item boundaries.

Done when:

- Snapshot tests of the tree for each declaration form of §6.
- Error recovery tests: a missing brace or semicolon in one member still yields trees for the following members.
- Accessor bodies on fields and getters (`{ get; }`, `{ get; set; }`) are syntax errors that recover at the next member.

### M1.4 Parser: statements and expressions

Spec: [§7](docs/design/mora.md#7-expressions-and-statements), [§14.4](docs/design/mora.md#144-lexer-and-parser). Crates: `mora-syntax`, `fuzz`. Blocked by: M1.3.

Statements of §7.11, Pratt parsing with the precedence table of §7.1, the postfix `?` disambiguation and `await e?` rule of §7.4, generic argument disambiguation and cast rules of §14.4, lambdas with capture lists, patterns of §7.8, switch expressions and statements, collection expressions, interpolation holes, `with`, `code { }` quotes and `#Name(...)` macro calls. A `cargo fuzz` target checks that parsing never panics and is lossless.

Done when:

- Snapshot tests for each row of §7.1 and each pattern of §7.8.
- `a ? b : c`, `x?`, `x?.y`, `await f()?` and `F<A, B>(c)` parse as §7.4 and §14.4 say.
- The fuzz target runs for 10 minutes in the nightly job without failures.

### M1.5 Withdrawn

Spec: [§3.4](docs/design/mora.md#34-keywords), [§23](docs/design/mora.md#23-decisions-register). Crates: `mora-syntax`, `mora-diag`. Blocked by: M1.4, M0.7.

Withdrawn by D-59: the compiler knows only Mora syntax, so code in another language's syntax gets the ordinary syntax error. The codes this deliverable added were removed.

### M1.6 Item tree, name resolution and entry points

Spec: [§4](docs/design/mora.md#4-program-structure), [§14.5](docs/design/mora.md#145-name-resolution-and-types). Crates: `mora-hir`, `mora-syntax`. Blocked by: M1.3.

Per-file item trees and the project def map: namespaces from folders with `MR0121` (D-96), nested types, `using`, `using static`, aliases, `global using`, the implicit prelude, the folder-default visibility of §4.5 (D-97), dependency names for path dependencies (resolved in M3.14), and entry point detection with `MR0124` and `MR0125`.

Done when:

- UI tests for ambiguous names, inaccessible members across folders (`MR0123`), folder names (`MR0121`) and both entry-point errors.
- A `salsa` test shows that editing a function body does not recompute the def map.

### M1.7 Types and signatures

Spec: [§5.1](docs/design/mora.md#51-kinds-of-type), [§5.2](docs/design/mora.md#52-primitive-types), [§5.5](docs/design/mora.md#55-tuples), [§6.2](docs/design/mora.md#62-structs). Crates: `mora-hir`. Blocked by: M1.6.

The type representation for primitives, `string`, unit, tuples, structs and function signatures (generic and class types arrive in M2 and M3), lowering of syntax types to types, and the signature query per item.

Done when:

- Unit tests resolve each primitive keyword and tuple form to its type.
- Unknown type names report an error with a suggestion of the closest name.

### M1.8 Body lowering to HIR

Spec: [§7](docs/design/mora.md#7-expressions-and-statements), [§14.5](docs/design/mora.md#145-name-resolution-and-types). Crates: `mora-hir`. Blocked by: M1.7.

Lowering of function bodies and top-level statements to HIR expressions and statements, with scopes, local declarations of §7.10, shadowing check `MR0180`, and name resolution of locals, parameters, members and items.

Done when:

- UI tests for `MR0180` and unresolved names.
- HIR dumps of the M1 run tests are snapshot-tested.

### M1.9 Type checking: core

Spec: [§5.10](docs/design/mora.md#510-conversions), [§7](docs/design/mora.md#7-expressions-and-statements), [§14.5](docs/design/mora.md#145-name-resolution-and-types). Crates: `mora-hir`, `mora-check`. Blocked by: M1.8.

Bidirectional checking of literals (target typing of §3.5), numeric conversions and promotions of §5.10 and §7.12, operators, calls with overload resolution and named and optional arguments, `let`/`var` locals and `MR0182`, `if`, `while`, `do`, `for`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, and definite assignment (`MR0181`).

Done when:

- UI tests for each conversion row of §5.10 and each error code above.
- Run tests for integer promotion and float target typing (`float x = 1.5;`).

### M1.10 MIR and lowering from HIR

Spec: [§14.7](docs/design/mora.md#147-mir). Crates: `mora-mir`. Blocked by: M1.9.

The MIR of §14.7 (bodies, blocks, places, operands, rvalues, statements, terminators), the stable textual dump behind `--emit mir`, and lowering of the M1 subset from HIR.

Done when:

- MIR snapshot tests for each M1 run test.
- A MIR validator (types match, every block terminated) runs after every pass in debug builds of the compiler.

### M1.11 Constant evaluation

Spec: [§4.7](docs/design/mora.md#47-static-state), [§14.6](docs/design/mora.md#146-constant-evaluation). Crates: `mora-mir`. Blocked by: M1.10.

A MIR interpreter for `const` values, `static mut` initializers and default parameter values with the subset of §14.6 and `MR0460` outside it.

Done when:

- Run tests using constants in array sizes, defaults and string concatenation.
- A UI test for `MR0460`.

### M1.12 Cranelift code generation

Spec: [§13.5](docs/design/mora.md#135-value-layouts), [§13.7](docs/design/mora.md#137-calling-convention-and-symbols), [§14.13](docs/design/mora.md#1413-cranelift-lowering). Crates: `mora-codegen`. Blocked by: M1.10, M0.13.

A `Backend` trait taking optimized MIR and a target description, and its Cranelift implementation: lowering of MIR for scalars, structs, tuples, calls, control flow, overflow-checked arithmetic and panics as `noreturn` runtime calls; object files through `cranelift-object`; in-process execution through `cranelift-jit`; struct layout of §13.5 computed from the target description and the calling convention of §13.7.

Done when:

- The run harness executes every M1 run test through the JIT and through an object file linked by M1.14, and compares outputs.
- Overflow in a debug build panics with the message of §11.4.

### M1.13 Runtime: startup, output and panics

Spec: [§13.1](docs/design/mora.md#131-the-runtime-library), [§13.8](docs/design/mora.md#138-startup-and-process-exit), [§11.4](docs/design/mora.md#114-panics). Crates: `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M0.10.

Process entry, argument collection, buffered stdout and stderr, panic message formatting (`panic at file:line:col: message`), backtraces when `MORA_BACKTRACE=1` or in the debug runtime, abort with exit code 101, stack overflow detection of §13.10, and immortal string literal objects.

Done when:

- Run tests for exit codes 0, an `int` from `Main`, and 101 on panic.
- A deep-recursion test prints `stack overflow` on every Tier 1 target.

### M1.14 Linking on Linux, macOS and Windows

Spec: [§14.14](docs/design/mora.md#1414-linking). Crates: `mora-link`. Blocked by: M0.11, M1.12, M1.13.

The linker driver of §14.14: `ld.lld` with musl for a fully static Linux executable, `xcrun ld` with `libSystem` on macOS, `lld-link` with MinGW pieces on Windows, an 8 MiB main-thread stack on Windows, and a clear error with the install command when a required tool is missing.

Done when:

- Hello world links and runs on every Tier 1 runner.
- On Linux, `file` reports the executable as statically linked.
- Removing the linker from `PATH` on macOS yields the `xcode-select --install` hint.

### M1.15 Standard library bootstrap and console output

Spec: [§15.1](docs/design/mora.md#151-prelude-std), [§15.6](docs/design/mora.md#156-console-environment-and-time), [§14.15](docs/design/mora.md#1415-standard-library-compilation). Crates: `std`, `mora-driver`. Blocked by: M1.9, M1.13.

The `std/` source tree embedded in the toolchain, the prelude as an implicit `global using Std;`, `Console.Write` and `Console.WriteLine` for primitives and `string`, `IDisplay` for primitives, and interpolated strings lowered to `Formatter` writes, without format specifiers yet.

Done when:

- §2.1 prints `Hello, world!`.
- Run tests interpolate every primitive type.

### M1.16 Driver and the build, run and check commands

Spec: [§14.15](docs/design/mora.md#1415-standard-library-compilation), [§17.1](docs/design/mora.md#171-commands), [§17.2](docs/design/mora.md#172-manifest), [§17.3](docs/design/mora.md#173-project-layout), [§17.4](docs/design/mora.md#174-profiles). Crates: `mora-driver`, `mora-pkg`, `mora-cli`. Blocked by: M1.14, M1.15.

Reading `mora.toml` (the `[project]` keys and profiles; unknown keys are `MR0500`), discovering `src/**/*.mr` and rejecting files of 4 GiB or more with `MR0003` (§3.1), the dev and release profiles of §17.4, the `target/` layout, the on-disk cache of the standard library's checked MIR, and `mora build`, `mora run` and `mora check`.

Done when:

- CLI tests build and run a temporary hello-world project in both profiles.
- A second build reuses the standard-library cache (asserted through a cache-hit counter in `--verbose` output).

### M1.17 Debug information and symbol names

Spec: [§13.7](docs/design/mora.md#137-calling-convention-and-symbols), [§14.13](docs/design/mora.md#1413-cranelift-lowering). Crates: `mora-codegen`, `mora-cli`. Blocked by: M1.12.

The mangling scheme of §13.7, `mora demangle`, demangled names in backtraces, and DWARF line tables from MIR spans on Linux and macOS.

Done when:

- A panic backtrace in a debug build shows `UsersApi.Program.Main` style names with `src/Program.mr:LINE`.
- `gdb` or `lldb` stops at a breakpoint set by `file:line` (manual check recorded in the pull request).

### M1.18 Third instruction set under emulation

Spec: [§19.1](docs/design/mora.md#191-targets), [§19.4](docs/design/mora.md#194-portability). Crates: `targets`, `.github/workflows`. Blocked by: M1.16.

The `riscv64gc-linux` target description, `mora-rt` and the musl sysroot for it, and a CI job that cross-builds the run-test suite and runs it under QEMU user-mode emulation.

Done when:

- The run tests pass on `riscv64gc-linux` under QEMU as a required check.

### M1.19 Grammar-driven parser fuzzing

Spec: [§14.4](docs/design/mora.md#144-lexer-and-parser), [§20.1](docs/design/mora.md#201-test-layers). Crates: `mora-syntax`, `fuzz`. Blocked by: M1.4.

A generator that writes programs from `mora.ungram`, adding parentheses where the rules of §14.4 and §7.4 would read the text another way, and a `cargo fuzz` target that parses each program, compares the tree with the shape it was generated from and prints it back (D-115).

Done when:

- The target runs for 10 minutes in the nightly job without failures.
- A unit test with a parser rule that disagrees with `mora.ungram` shows the check reporting the mismatch.

### M1.20 Fix applicability, `mora fix` and watch mode

`applicability` on every fix and `schema` on every JSON object (D-113), the deterministic order of diagnostics, `mora fix` with `--code` and `--applicability`, and `mora check --watch` with its summary per round.

Done when:

- CLI tests: `mora fix` applies a `safe` fix and leaves a `review` one, applies both with `--applicability review`, and `--code` limits it to one code.
- Two runs of `mora check --message-format json` on the same project print the same bytes.
- A watch-mode test edits a file and receives a new round that ends with the summary object.

## M2: Memory model

**Goal.** Classes, structs, unique classes, parameter modes, moves, drops, destructors, borrows, views, weak references and closures, with ARC inserted and optimized, and a test suite that proves the rules of §10.

**Exit criteria.** The suite of §20.3 passes; the §10.13 snapshots pass.

The getter cheapness check (`MR0251`) and the part of `MR0252` about capabilities and `dyn` calls need the effect analysis of §6.14 and arrive with M3.18.

Done when:

- UI tests for `MR0140`, `MR0143`, `MR0144` and assigning a read-only field.
- UI tests for writes outside a field's write scope, `redundant-mut-scope` and `MR0252`.

Done when:

- A run test reads `none` after the target dies.

- UI tests for each closure error.
- A non-escaping lambda allocates nothing (allocation counter in the debug runtime).

### M2.12 ARC insertion

Spec: [§14.11](docs/design/mora.md#1411-arc-insertion). Crates: `mora-mir`. Blocked by: M2.11.

### M3.13 Statics

Spec: [§4.7](docs/design/mora.md#47-static-state). Crates: `mora-hir`, `mora-mir`, `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M1.11, M3.5.

`const` in read-only data, constant sequences as `ReadOnlySpan<T>`, `static lazy` with run-time cycle detection and `MR0126`, and `static mut`.

Done when:

- A lazy cycle panics with the message of §4.7.
- A `const` string longer than 15 bytes is an immortal object in read-only data, and reading it never writes its count.

### M3.14 Local path dependencies and library projects

Spec: [§4.4](docs/design/mora.md#44-dependencies), [§17.2](docs/design/mora.md#172-manifest). Crates: `mora-driver`, `mora-pkg`, `mora-hir`. Blocked by: M3.10.

`kind = "lib"`, root namespaces, `[dependencies]` path entries whose keys bind each dependency's root namespace (D-96), `MR0122`, `MR0501`, the dependency-cycle check `MR0502`, and `mora.lock` with path entries.

Done when:

- A two-project example (app plus library) builds and runs.
- A remote dependency source reports `MR0122`.
- Two path dependencies that depend on each other report `MR0502`.

### M3.15 Attributes: `Cfg`, lint levels and `Obsolete`

Spec: [§6.11](docs/design/mora.md#611-attributes), [§17.2](docs/design/mora.md#172-manifest). Crates: `mora-hir`, `mora-check`, `mora-driver`. Blocked by: M3.14.

Built-in attributes other than macros and `Test`: `@Cfg` with `Os`, `Arch`, `Debug`, `Test`, `Feature`; `[features]` in the manifest; `@Allow`, `@Warn`, `@Deny` and `[lints]`; `@Obsolete` with `MR2003`; `@Inline`; `@Layout(C)`; `@MustUse` on functions.

Done when:

- A `@Cfg(Os = "windows")` function compiles only on Windows CI.
- `@Deny("MR2002")` turns the warning into an error.

### M3.16 Platform capabilities and standard library layers

Spec: [§19.4](docs/design/mora.md#194-portability), [§15](docs/design/mora.md#15-standard-library-mvp-surface). Crates: `std`, `mora-hir`, `mora-target`. Blocked by: M3.15.

`Std.Core`, `Std.Alloc` and the hosted rest of `Std` as in §19.4 rule 4, capability tags on every hosted API, and `MR0510` when a program uses an API whose capability the target lacks.

Done when:

- A program using `File` against a test target description without `fs` reports `MR0510` naming `File`, `fs` and the target.
- `Std.Core` compiles for the 32-bit test description with no `heap` capability.

### M3.17 Interpolation handlers

Spec: [§7.14](docs/design/mora.md#714-interpolation-handlers), [§7.13](docs/design/mora.md#713-other-expressions), [§8.5](docs/design/mora.md#85-built-in-interfaces). Crates: `mora-hir`, `mora-mir`, `std`. Blocked by: M3.10.

`IInterpolate`, `IHole<T>` and `Literal` (D-105): lowering an interpolated string whose target implements `IInterpolate` to `Begin`, `AppendLiteral`, and `AppendHole` for holes that implement `IHole<T>` or `AppendDisplay` for other `IDisplay` holes, skipping every part when `Enabled` is `false`, the hole's format and source text, and lint `unchecked-injection`. Lint `skipped-hole-effects` needs the effect analysis of §6.14 and arrives with M3.18.

Done when:

- A test handler records its calls: literal parts and holes arrive in source order, with each hole's format and source text.
- A hole with a side effect does not run when `Enabled` is `false`.
- A hole type with only `IDisplay` goes to `AppendDisplay`, and one that also implements `IHole<T>` goes to `AppendHole`.
- UI tests: a hole type with neither `IHole<T>` nor `IDisplay` is an error naming both; assigning a `string` to a handler type does not compile.

### M3.18 Effect inference and `uses` bounds

Spec: [§6.14](docs/design/mora.md#614-effects), [§6.9](docs/design/mora.md#69-members). Crates: `mora-hir`, `mora-mir`, `mora-check`, `mora-cli`. Blocked by: M2.11, M3.11, M3.16, M3.17.

Effect sets per function (D-102) from `@RequiresCapability`, `@Blocking`, `extern` functions (`ffi`) and `Secret<T>.Use` (`secret`), inferred per strongly connected component of the call graph and per generic instantiation, with closures passed to `in` parameters charged to the caller and `dyn` for calls through escaping function values and `any I` without a bound. `uses` bounds on functions, interface methods and function types, checked with `MR0250` and the call path that brings the effect in, and `mora explain-effects`. The getter cheapness check `MR0251` (D-103) with `@Cheap` trusted inside `Std`, the part of `MR0252` about capabilities and `dyn` calls, and lint `skipped-hole-effects`. Hover (M7.3) and the inlay hint (M7.4) read the same data.

Done when:

- A `uses none` function that calls `Clock.Now()` is `MR0250`, and the message shows the path `clock <- Clock.Now`.
- Two mutually recursive functions, one of which reads the clock, both infer `clock` with no annotation.
- `list.Sort(compare)` infers exactly the effects of `compare`, and a call through a stored function value without a bound adds `dyn`.
- UI tests for `MR0251` reporting a loop, a heap allocation, a mutation and a failure, each naming the call.
- `mora explain-effects` prints each effect of a function with its call path.

## M4: Macros

**Goal.** Attribute and expression macros written in Mora, run at compile time on a typed model, plus the standard-library macros that replace a derive list.

**Exit criteria.** Every §9 example runs; `@Equatable`, `@Hashable`, `@Comparable`, `@Display`, `@Default`, `@Clone` and `#Assert` pass their `MacroTest` suites; structs get their automatic implementations from these macros.

### M4.2 The `Std.Meta` model

Spec: [§9.5](docs/design/mora.md#95-the-typed-model-stdmeta). Crates: `mora-hir`, `std`. Blocked by: M4.1.

The read-only model of §9.5 built from HIR signatures (`Type`, `Field`, `Getter`, `Method`, `Case`, `Attribute`, `Expr`), `Fail` and `Warn` with locations in user code.

Done when:

- Unit tests build the model of each declaration kind and compare it with a snapshot.

### M4.3 Macro runner and sandbox

Spec: [§9.7](docs/design/mora.md#97-running-macros), [§14.2](docs/design/mora.md#142-crates). Crates: `mora-macro`, `mora-hir`. Blocked by: M4.2.

The `MacroRunner` interface in `mora-hir` and its implementation in `mora-macro`: compiling macros with the JIT, the capability sandbox (`MR0613`), the 5-second and 256 MiB limits, panics reported at the use site, and same-project cycles (`MR0614`).

Done when:

- An infinite loop in a macro fails after 5 seconds with the use site in the message.

### M4.4 Expansion, ordering and hygiene

Spec: [§9.4](docs/design/mora.md#94-hygiene), [§9.6](docs/design/mora.md#96-what-a-macro-sees). Crates: `mora-macro`, `mora-hir`. Blocked by: M4.3.

### M4.6 Expansion cache

Spec: [§9.7](docs/design/mora.md#97-running-macros). Crates: `mora-macro`. Blocked by: M4.4.

Caching each expansion under a hash of the toolchain version, the model it read, and the MIR of the macro and every function it calls transitively, in the `salsa` database and on disk.

Done when:

- Editing a method body does not rerun any macro (counter in `--verbose`).
- Editing a field reruns only the macros on that type.
- Editing a helper function a macro calls reruns that macro.

### M4.7 Seeing and testing expansions

Spec: [§9.8](docs/design/mora.md#98-seeing-and-debugging-expansions). Crates: `mora-cli`, `mora-macro`, `std`. Blocked by: M4.5.

Done when:

- `cargo xtask spec-examples` runs the guide's examples.

### M4.9 Standard-library macros

Spec: [§9.1](docs/design/mora.md#91-a-complete-example), [§9.6](docs/design/mora.md#96-what-a-macro-sees), [§9.9](docs/design/mora.md#99-standard-library-macros), [§6.2](docs/design/mora.md#62-structs). Crates: `std`, `mora-hir`. Blocked by: M4.7.

`@Equatable`, `@Hashable`, `@Comparable`, `@Display`, `@Default`, `@Clone` and `#Assert` with the behaviour of §9.9, and their automatic application to structs, tuples, enums and unions. `@Error` on unions and structs, with `@Code`, `@Public` and `@Status` (D-108), and helper attributes with `MR0615`.

Done when:

- A `MacroTest` suite per macro.
- §9.1's example prints `True`; structs compare by fields and print as `User { Id = 1, ... }`.

## M5: Standard library core

**Goal.** Text, collections, LINQ, console, environment, time, files, JSON, logging, secrets and testing: enough standard library for real programs.

**Exit criteria.** The std API reference builds from doc comments; JSONTestSuite parsing cases pass; LINQ chains meet §15.5 with no allocation.

### M5.1 Standard library internals

Spec: [§13.11](docs/design/mora.md#1311-standard-library-internals). Crates: `mora-hir`, `mora-mir`, `std`. Blocked by: M3.11.

The private `unsafe` dialect of §13.11 accepted only when compiling `Std` (`MR0107` elsewhere), `RawPtr<T>`, `Uninit<T>`, the intrinsics, the `RawDeref` projection, and MIR checks skipping raw places. Documented in `std/README.md`.

Done when:

- Using `unsafe` in a user project reports `MR0107`.
- A test-only `std` module moves values through raw storage with no leak.

### M5.2 Strings, text and formatting

Spec: [§5.3](docs/design/mora.md#53-strings), [§15.2](docs/design/mora.md#152-strings-and-text). Crates: `std`, `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M5.1, M4.9.

The `string`, `StringBuilder`, `Formatter` and `char` members of §15.2, byte-offset slicing with boundary panics, `MR0130`, and the format specifiers of §15.2 for interpolation and `ToString(spec)`.

Done when:

- Run tests for every member, including non-ASCII and astral-plane text.
- Format specifier tests match .NET invariant-culture output for a table of values.

### M5.3 Number parsing and formatting

Spec: [§8.5](docs/design/mora.md#85-built-in-interfaces), [§15.1](docs/design/mora.md#151-prelude-std). Crates: `std`, `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M5.2.

`IParse<T>`, `int.Parse` and the other primitives returning `Result<T, ParseError>`, shortest round-trip float formatting and correct float parsing in the runtime.

Done when:

- Round-trip property tests for `double`.
- Parsing errors carry the offending text.

### M5.4 List, arrays, spans and memory

Spec: [§10.10](docs/design/mora.md#1010-growable-collections-and-interior-views), [§15.3](docs/design/mora.md#153-collections). Crates: `std`, `mora-mir`. Blocked by: M5.1, M2.9.

`List<T>` with borrow count and version, the array, span and memory members of §15.3, `Sort` overloads, and the hidden span guards of §10.10 inserted by the view check.

Done when:

- Adding to a list while a span of it is live panics with the §10.10 message.
- Memory suite additions for collections (§20.3).

### M5.5 Dictionary, HashSet, Queue and Stack

Spec: [§15.3](docs/design/mora.md#153-collections), [§15.4](docs/design/mora.md#154-lookups-never-panic). Crates: `std`, `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M5.4, M3.18.

Insertion-ordered `Dictionary` (D-29) with SipHash-1-3 and per-process keys, the members of §15.3 and §15.4 including `Get` returning `TValue?`, `HashSet`, `Queue` and `Stack`. The `Dictionary` index `get` and `Count`, and `HashSet.Contains` and `Count`, are marked `@Cheap` (D-103), and `@Cheap` outside `Std` is `MR0254`.

Done when:

- Iteration order equals insertion order after removals and re-insertions.
- `Add` of a present key returns `false` and changes nothing; assigning `none` through the indexer removes the key.
- UI test: a getter that reads `dict[key]` passes the getter check, and `@Cheap` on a function outside `Std` is `MR0254`.

### M5.6 Enumeration protocol and foreach

Spec: [§7.11](docs/design/mora.md#711-statements), [§8.5](docs/design/mora.md#85-built-in-interfaces), [§10.10](docs/design/mora.md#1010-growable-collections-and-interior-views). Crates: `std`, `mora-mir`. Blocked by: M5.4.

`IEnumerable<T>` and `IEnumerator<T>`, `foreach` with `let`, `var` and `ref var`, version-checked enumerators (D-42), and boxed enumerators through `IEnumerable<T>` values.

Done when:

- Modifying a list inside `foreach` panics with `collection was modified during enumeration`.
- A method returning `IEnumerable<User>` works with `foreach` and LINQ.

### M5.7 LINQ

Spec: [§15.5](docs/design/mora.md#155-linq), [§10.9](docs/design/mora.md#109-closures). Crates: `std`. Blocked by: M5.6, M2.11.

The operators of §15.5 as iterator structs taking closure structs, buffering operators, and the `OrNull` variants.

Done when:

- A `Where`/`Select`/`Sum` chain allocates nothing (debug runtime counter).
- Each operator has run tests against expected sequences.

### M5.8 Console, environment, time and random

Spec: [§12.1](docs/design/mora.md#121-execution-model-in-the-mvp), [§15.6](docs/design/mora.md#156-console-environment-and-time). Crates: `std`, `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M5.2.

The World seam in the per-thread context (D-109), through which the clock and `Random.Shared` read, and the members of §15.6: `Console` input and error output, `Environment`, `Random`, `Math` and `MathF`, and the time types of D-111 (`Clock`, `Instant`, `MonoTime`, `TimeSpan`, `Stopwatch`, `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `Period`, `TimeError`) and lint `wall-clock-duration`. `@RequiresCapability` tags go on the members that use a capability, such as `Clock.Now()` and `MonoTime.Now()` (`clock`) and `Random.Shared` (`random`); value types and their arithmetic need none.

Done when:

- `Clock.Now().ToString()` matches RFC 3339 in UTC, and `Instant.Parse` reads it back.
- `LocalDate.Of(2026, 2, 30)` is an `Err`, and January 31 plus `Period.Months(1)` is the last day of February.
- A UI test for `wall-clock-duration` and its fix.
- `Console.ReadLine()` returns `none` at end of input.

### M5.9 Files, directories and paths

Spec: [§15.7](docs/design/mora.md#157-files-and-networking). Crates: `std`, `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M5.8.

`File`, `Directory`, `Path` and `IoError` of §15.7, with platform path rules on Windows.

Done when:

- Run tests on a temporary directory on every Tier 1 target.
- `IoError.NotFound` for a missing file prints a message with the path.

### M5.10 JSON values, parser and writer

Spec: [§16.3](docs/design/mora.md#163-json-stdjson). Crates: `std`. Blocked by: M5.5.

`JsonValue`, `Json.Parse` over strings and bytes, compact and indented output, `JsonError` with line and column, the depth limit and duplicate-key rule.

Done when:

- The JSONTestSuite `y_` cases parse and `n_` cases fail.
- `{not json` fails with `at line 1, column 2: expected string`.

### M5.11 The `@Json` macro

Spec: [§16.3](docs/design/mora.md#163-json-stdjson), [§9.9](docs/design/mora.md#99-standard-library-macros). Crates: `std`. Blocked by: M5.10, M4.9.

`@Json`, `IJsonSerialize`, `IJsonDeserialize`, `Json.Serialize` and `Json.Deserialize` with every mapping row of §16.3, `@JsonName`, `@JsonIgnore`, `@JsonStrict` and `@JsonTag`.

Done when:

- Round-trip tests for each row of the §16.3 table.
- A missing non-optional property fails with `missing property "name"`.

### M5.12 Testing library and `mora test`

Spec: [§15.9](docs/design/mora.md#159-testing), [§17.5](docs/design/mora.md#175-test-runner), [§20.4](docs/design/mora.md#204-executable-examples). Crates: `std`, `mora-driver`, `mora-cli`, `mora-testkit`. Blocked by: M5.7, M5.8, M5.11.

`@Test`, `Std.Testing.Assert`, `Assert.Panics` in a child process, unit tests in `src/` and integration tests in `tests/`, one process per test, `--leak-check` on by default, the output format of §17.5, and test seeds (D-109): one seed per run for `Random.Shared` (and for the scheduler once M6.3 lands), printed on failure and replayed with `--seed`. Doc-comment examples run as tests with the checks of §20.4, and `Assert.Snapshot`, `Assert.SnapshotJson` and `--bless` keep snapshot files in `tests/snapshots/` (D-114).

Done when:

- A project with a passing, a failing, a panicking and an ignored test prints `Passed: 1, Failed: 2, Ignored: 1` and exits 1.
- A test that fails for some values of `Random.Shared` prints its seed, and `--seed` with that seed fails it again with the same values.
- A doc-comment example with a wrong `// expect:` line fails under its example name, and an `// error: MRnnnn` example passes when that code is reported.
- `Assert.Snapshot` and `Assert.SnapshotJson` fail after the value changes, a second snapshot in the same test uses `<test>.2.snap`, `mora test --bless` rewrites every file the test uses, and the next run passes.

### M5.13 Signals and `@Observable`

Spec: [§15.8](docs/design/mora.md#158-events), [§9.9](docs/design/mora.md#99-standard-library-macros), [§6.11](docs/design/mora.md#611-attributes). Crates: `std`, `mora-hir`. Blocked by: M5.4, M2.10, M4.9.

`Signal<T>`, `Subscribe(move handler: (T) => ())` returning a unique `Subscription`, `SubscribeWeak`, and `Emit`. The `@Observable` macro (D-104) and the `@SoleWriter` attribute with `MR0253`.

Done when:

- Dropping the subscription stops delivery; a weak subscriber that died is skipped and removed.
- `SetX` on an `@Observable` class emits `XChanged` only when the value changed, and the signal of a `stored` getter that reads `X` after it.
- UI test: assigning an observed field outside `SetX`, inside or outside the class, is `MR0253` with a fix that calls `SetX`.

### M5.14 `Html`, `Url` and `Literal`

Spec: [§15.2](docs/design/mora.md#152-strings-and-text), [§7.14](docs/design/mora.md#714-interpolation-handlers). Crates: `std`. Blocked by: M5.2, M3.17.

The `Literal` members, and the `Html` and `Url` handlers of §15.2 (D-105): escaping by context for element text and quoted attribute values, percent-encoding by URL component, the panics for holes in other positions, nested `Html` holes, and `Unchecked`.

Done when:

- Escaping tests for text, quoted attributes, path segments, query names and values, and fragments, including non-ASCII text.
- A hole inside `<script>` panics with the context; an `Html` hole in element text is not escaped twice, and one in an attribute value is escaped.
- In `href`, a hole after `/users/` is percent-encoded, a hole at the start of the value that is not a `Url` panics, and a hole in `onclick` panics.

### M5.15 Logging and tracing

Spec: [§15.10](docs/design/mora.md#1510-logging-and-tracing), [§7.14](docs/design/mora.md#714-interpolation-handlers). Crates: `std`, `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M5.8, M5.10, M3.17.

`Log.Trace` to `Log.Error` through one log message handler per level (D-107), fields named after each hole's source text with `#2` for repeats, `MORA_LOG` and `MORA_LOG_FORMAT=json`, and `Trace.Span` with its end on drop. Spawned tasks inheriting the current span come with M6.3, and redacted `Secret<T>` holes with M5.16.

Done when:

- A disabled level evaluates no hole.
- JSON output has the template, one field per hole, the level, the time and the span; a span ends on an early `?` return with its duration.

### M5.16 `Secret<T>`

Spec: [§15.11](docs/design/mora.md#1511-secrets), [§16.3](docs/design/mora.md#163-json-stdjson), [§6.14](docs/design/mora.md#614-effects). Crates: `std`, `mora-hir`. Blocked by: M5.11, M5.15, M3.18.

`Secret<T>` for `string` and `byte[]` (D-106): redacted `IDisplay`, `Use` through a span view, zeroing in the destructor, `Clone`, lint `secret-copied`, and `@Json` reading secrets and writing them only with `@JsonSecret`, leaving them out otherwise. The `secret` fact in `mora explain-effects` needs the effect analysis of §6.14 and arrives with it.

Done when:

- Interpolating, logging and printing a secret show `Secret<string>(***)`.
- With the debug runtime, a free hook sees the secret's bytes already zero when its buffer is released.
- `Json.Serialize` of a type with a `Secret<T>` field and no `@JsonSecret` leaves the field out; with `@JsonSecret` it writes the plaintext.

### M5.17 `Report` and `Context`

Spec: [§11.5](docs/design/mora.md#115-reports), [§11.2](docs/design/mora.md#112-error-types). Crates: `std`. Blocked by: M5.2.

`Report` over `any IError` with context lines (D-108), `Context(message)` with a string or a lambda, `Report()`, the printed chain, and `MR0201` with fixes that add `.Report()` or `.Context("...")` for a bare `?` into `Report`.

Done when:

- A three-level chain prints the newest context first, then the error and the chain of its `Source()`.
- An `Ok` passed through `Context(() => ...)` never runs the lambda.

### M5.18 Standard library API reference

Spec: [§15](docs/design/mora.md#15-standard-library-mvp-surface). Crates: `xtask`, `std`. Blocked by: M5.9, M5.12, M5.13, M5.14, M5.15, M5.16, M5.17.

`cargo xtask std-docs` generates HTML reference pages from `std/` doc comments, linking backtick symbol names, and checks that every member §15 lists exists.

Done when:

- The check fails when a member named in §15 is missing from `std/`.

## M6: Async and HTTP

**Goal.** Async functions, the single-threaded executor, TCP, and an HTTP/1.1 server with routing and JSON: the REST API of §2.2 runs.

**Exit criteria.** The acceptance test of §20.2 passes on every Tier 1 target. The MVP is functionally complete.

### M6.1 Async functions and futures: language rules

Spec: [§12.2](docs/design/mora.md#122-async-functions-and-futures), [§10.3](docs/design/mora.md#103-parameter-modes), [§7.4](docs/design/mora.md#74-propagation-). Crates: `mora-hir`, `std`. Blocked by: M5.7, M3.18.

`async` functions, methods and lambdas, `Future<T>` as a unique `@MustUse` cold type (D-27), `await`, `MR0312`, `MR0313`, `MR0400`, `MR0401` and `MR0404`, the `await e?` rule, and lint `blocking-in-async` (D-102).

Done when:

- UI tests for every code.
- `async (req: Request) => ...` infers its future type from the target.
- `blocking-in-async` reports an `async` function that reaches a test function marked `@Blocking` two calls down, and shows the path.

### M6.2 Async lowering

Spec: [§12.3](docs/design/mora.md#123-lowering), [§14.9](docs/design/mora.md#149-async-lowering). Crates: `mora-mir`. Blocked by: M6.1.

State machines per §14.9: parameters moved into the state, locals live across `await` as fields, numbered suspension points, per-state drop functions, and `MR0340` for borrows across `await`.

Done when:

- MIR snapshots of a lowered function with two `await`s.
- Dropping a future at each suspension point runs the right destructors (run test).

### M6.3 Executor, tasks and cancellation

Spec: [§12.1](docs/design/mora.md#121-execution-model-in-the-mvp), [§12.4](docs/design/mora.md#124-tasks), [§12.5](docs/design/mora.md#125-cancellation), [§15.10](docs/design/mora.md#1510-logging-and-tracing). Crates: `mora-rt`, `std`. Blocked by: M6.2, M5.12, M5.15.

Task scheduling through the World (D-109), with a choice among ready tasks seeded by the `mora test` seed, the single-threaded executor and wakers, `Task.WhenAll`, `WhenAny`, a fail-fast `Scope` (D-110), `SpawnDetached` with lint `detached-task`, `TaskHandle<T>`, `Delay`, `Yield`, inherited deadlines with `WithTimeout`, `WithDeadline` and `Remaining`, cancellation by drop, cancellation of detached tasks when `Main` returns, and spawned tasks inheriting the current log span (§15.10).

Done when:

- `WhenAll` of two 100 ms delays completes in under 150 ms.
- `WithTimeout` cancels its future at the deadline and the future's destructors run; a nested `WithTimeout` with a longer duration keeps the outer deadline.
- A scope child that returns `Err` cancels a sibling blocked in `Delay` and the scope returns that `Err`, without the body awaiting the child.
- Under one seed, a test with three tasks that interleave at `Yield` produces the same order on every run.
- An event logged inside a spawned task belongs to the span that was current where it was spawned.

### M6.4 Async entry points

Spec: [§4.6](docs/design/mora.md#46-entry-point), [§12.2](docs/design/mora.md#122-async-functions-and-futures). Crates: `mora-hir`, `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M6.3.

Spec: [§12.1](docs/design/mora.md#121-execution-model-in-the-mvp), [§15.7](docs/design/mora.md#157-files-and-networking). Crates: `mora-rt`, `std`. Blocked by: M6.3.

The `mio` reactor on epoll, kqueue and IOCP, timers, `TcpListener` and `TcpStream` as shared classes closing on drop (D-18), with `Memory<byte>` buffers (D-45), and `IoError` mapping.

Done when:

- An echo server and client in Mora exchange 10 MB on every Tier 1 target.
- Dropping a listener frees the port immediately for a new `Bind`.

### M6.6 HTTP/1.1 connections

Spec: [§16.1](docs/design/mora.md#161-http-server-stdnethttp). Crates: `std`, `mora-rt`. Blocked by: M6.5.

Request-head parsing with `httparse` in the runtime, keep-alive, `Content-Length` and chunked request bodies, `Expect: 100-continue`, `Connection: close`, `Date` and `Server` headers, every limit and timeout of §16.1 with its status code, and the global body memory budget with backpressure.

Done when:

- Protocol tests over raw TCP for each limit (413, 431, idle timeout).
- With the body budget set to 1 MiB, 64 clients each sending a 1 MiB body are served one budget at a time, and a client that waits more than 5 s gets 503 with `Retry-After: 1`.
- Pipelined requests on one connection are answered in order.

### M6.7 WebApp, routing and results

Spec: [§16.1](docs/design/mora.md#161-http-server-stdnethttp), [§16.2](docs/design/mora.md#162-httperror). Crates: `std`. Blocked by: M6.6, M5.11, M5.15.

Done when:

- Routing table tests for literal-before-parameter order and `{*rest}`.
- Shutdown with an in-flight request completes it within 5 s.
- With `RequestTimeout` set to 100 ms, a handler that awaits `Task.Delay` for 1 s returns 503 at about 100 ms and its future's destructors run.
- An internal error returns 500 with a problem+json body holding only its code and trace id, and the log has the full chain under that trace id.

### M6.8 The users API example and acceptance test

Spec: [§2.2](docs/design/mora.md#22-the-mvp-acceptance-program), [§20.2](docs/design/mora.md#202-the-mvp-acceptance-test). Crates: `examples/users-api`, `mora-testkit`. Blocked by: M6.7.

Done when:

- The transcript of §2.2 matches byte for byte on every Tier 1 target.
- The job is added to the org required checks.

`mora fmt` and `--check` with the layout of §17.7, idempotent and whitespace-only apart from trailing commas, `using` order and the parentheses around a propagation `?` before `:`, and the `format` lint of `mora check` (`MR2030`, D-115). `std/` and `examples/` are formatted in CI.

Done when:

- Idempotence and token-preservation tests over every `.mr` file in the repository.
- `c ? r? : d` formats as `c ? (r?) : d`, and `x?[i]` and `flag ? [1] : []` keep their spacing.

- Every channel of §19.3 serves v0.1.0.
- The spec says what an edition may change, how an edition is chosen in `mora.toml`, and that every edition change ships with a `safe` fix.
