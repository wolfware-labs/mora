//! Item trees, name resolution, types, inference and HIR bodies; defines the macro-runner interface (§14.5).
//!
//! The front of the analysis is three layers of `salsa` queries (§14.3):
//!
//! - [`parse`] gives the syntax tree of a file.
//! - [`item_tree`] gives what a file declares: its `using` directives, its
//!   items with their names, kinds, visibility and nested types, and whether
//!   it has top-level statements. It holds no text ranges, so an edit inside
//!   a body leaves it equal and nothing that reads it runs again. The ranges
//!   diagnostics need are in [`item_source_map`].
//! - [`def_map`] puts the item trees of a project together: the namespaces
//!   its folders give (§4.2), the items in each, the dependencies and the
//!   entry point (§4.6).
//!
//! [`resolve_path`] looks a path up from a file, in the order of §14.5, and
//! [`diagnostics`] reports what is wrong with a project's folders, `using`
//! directives and entry point.
