//! File ids, spans, line indexes, interning and the base analysis database (§14.2, §14.3).
//!
//! Everything the compiler reports or caches is anchored to a [`Span`]: a
//! [`FileId`] and a byte range in that file. [`LineIndex`] turns byte offsets
//! into the line and column positions people and editors use, in UTF-8 bytes
//! for diagnostics and in UTF-16 code units for the LSP. [`Db`] is the
//! `salsa` database trait every later crate extends, with the source text and
//! project layout as its inputs.
